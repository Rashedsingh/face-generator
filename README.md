# About

This is a script to generate new images of human faces using the technique of generative adversarial networks (GAN), as described in the paper by [Ian J. Goodfellow](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).
GANs train two networks at the same time: A Generator (G) that draws/creates new images and a Discriminator (D) that distinguishes between real and fake images. G learns to trick D into thinking that his images are real (i.e. learns to produce good looking images). D learns to prevent getting tricked (i.e. learns what real images look like).
Ideally you end up with a G that produces beautiful images that look like real ones. On human faces that works reasonably well, probably because they contain a lot of structure (autoencoders work well on them too).

The code in this repository is a modified version of facebook's [eyescream project](https://github.com/facebook/eyescream).

This project is tested with BrowserStack

# Example images

The following images were generated by a model trained with `th train.lua --D_L1=0 --D_L2=0 --D_iterations=2`.

![32x32 color](images/color_random1024.jpg?raw=true "32x32 color")

*1024 randomly generated 32x32 face images.*

![64 color images rated as good](images/color_best.jpg?raw=true "64 color images rated as good")

*64 generated 32x32 images, rated by D as the best images among 1024 randomly generated ones.*

![Nearest neighbours of generated 32x32 images](images/color_neighbours.jpg?raw=true "Nearest neighbours of generated 32x32 images")

*16 generated images (each pair left) and their nearest neighbours from the training set (each pair right). Distance was measured by 2-Norm (`torch.dist()`). The 16 selected images were the "best" ones among 1024 images according to the rating by D, hence some similarity with the training set is expected.*

# Requirements

To generate the dataset:
* [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) (original dataset without funneling)
* Python 2.7 (only tested with that version)
  * Scipy
  * Numpy
  * scikit-image

To run the GAN part:
* [Torch](http://torch.ch/) with the following libraries (most of them are probably already installed by default):
  * `pl` (`luarocks install pl`)
  * `nn` (`luarocks install nn`)
  * `paths` (`luarocks install paths`)
  * `image` (`luarocks install image`)
  * `optim` (`luarocks install optim`)
  * `cutorch` (`luarocks install cutorch`)
  * `cunn` (`luarocks install cunn`)
  * `cudnn` (`luarocks install cudnn`)
  * `dpnn` (`luarocks install dpnn`)
* [display](https://github.com/szym/display)
* Nvidia GPU with >= 4 GB memory
* cudnn3

# Usage

Building the dataset:
* Download [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and extract it somewhere
* In `dataset/` run `python generate_dataset.py --path="/foo/bar/lfw"`, where `/foo/bar/lfw` is the path to your LFW dataset

To train a new model, follow these steps:
* Start `display` with `~/.display/run.js &`
* Open `http://localhost:8000` to see the training progress
* Train a 32x32 color generator with `th train.lua` (add `--grayscale` for grayscale images)
* Sample images with `th sample.lua`. Add `--neighbours` to sample nearest neighbours (takes long). Add e.g. `--runs=10` to generate 10 times the amount of images.

You might have to work with the command line parameters `--D_iterations` and `--G_iterations` to get decent performance.
Sometimes you also might have to change `--D_L2` (D's L2 norm) or `--G_L2` (G's L2 norm). (Similar parameters are available for L1.)

# Architecture

G's architecture is mostly copied from the [blog post](http://torch.ch/blog/2015/11/13/gan.html) by Anders Boesen Lindbo Larsen and Søren Kaae Sønderby.
It is basically a full laplacian pyramid in one network.
The network starts with a small linear layer, which roughly generates 8x8 images.
That is followed by upsampling layers, which increase the image size to 16x16 and then 32x32 pixels.

```lua
local model = nn.Sequential()
model:add(nn.Linear(noiseDim, 128*8*8))
model:add(nn.View(128, 8, 8))
model:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))

model:add(nn.SpatialUpSamplingNearest(2))
model:add(cudnn.SpatialConvolution(128, 256, 5, 5, 1, 1, (5-1)/2, (5-1)/2))
model:add(nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(256))
model:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))

model:add(nn.SpatialUpSamplingNearest(2))
model:add(cudnn.SpatialConvolution(256, 128, 5, 5, 1, 1, (5-1)/2, (5-1)/2))
model:add(nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(128))
model:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))

model:add(cudnn.SpatialConvolution(128, dimensions[1], 3, 3, 1, 1, (3-1)/2, (3-1)/2))
model:add(nn.Sigmoid())
```
where `noiseDim` is 100 and `dimensions[1]` is 3 (color mode) or 1 (grayscale mode).

D is a standard convolutional neural net.

```lua
local conv = nn.Sequential()
conv:add(nn.SpatialConvolution(dimensions[1], 64, 3, 3, 1, 1, (3-1)/2))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.SpatialDropout(0.2))
conv:add(nn.SpatialAveragePooling(2, 2, 2, 2))

conv:add(nn.SpatialConvolution(64, 128, 3, 3, 1, 1, (3-1)/2))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.SpatialDropout(0.2))
conv:add(nn.SpatialAveragePooling(2, 2, 2, 2))

conv:add(nn.SpatialConvolution(128, 256, 3, 3, 1, 1, (3-1)/2))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.SpatialDropout(0.2))
conv:add(nn.SpatialAveragePooling(2, 2, 2, 2))

conv:add(nn.SpatialConvolution(256, 512, 3, 3, 1, 1, (3-1)/2))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.SpatialDropout(0.2))
conv:add(nn.SpatialAveragePooling(2, 2, 2, 2))

conv:add(nn.View(512 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * dimensions[2] * dimensions[3]))
conv:add(nn.Linear(512 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * dimensions[2] * dimensions[3], 512))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.Dropout())
conv:add(nn.Linear(512, 512))
conv:add(nn.PReLU(nil, nil, true))
conv:add(nn.Dropout())
conv:add(nn.Linear(512, 1))
conv:add(nn.Sigmoid())
```
where `dimensions[1]` is 3 (color) or 1 (grayscale), and `dimensions[2]` is the height of 32 (same as `dimensions[3]`).

Training is done with Adam (by default).

# Command Line Parameters

The `train.lua` script has the following parameters:
* `--batchSize` (default 16): The size of each batch, which will be split in two parts for G and D, making each one of them half-size. So a setting of 4 will create a batch of size of 2 for D (one image fake, one real) and another batch of size 2 for G. Because of that, the minimum size is 4 (and batches must be even sized).
* `--save` (default "logs"): Directory to save the weights to.
* `--saveFreq` (default 30): Save weights every N epochs.
* `--network` (default ""): Name of a weights file in the save directory to load.
* `--noplot`: Whether to NOT plot during training.
* `--N_epoch` (default 1000): How many examples to use during each epoch (-1 means "use the whole dataset").
* `--G_SGD_lr` (default 0.02): Learning rate for G's SGD, if SGD is used as the optimizer. (Note: There is no decay. You should use Adam or Adagrad.)
* `--G_SGD_momentum` (default 0): Momentum for G's SGD.
* `--D_SGD_lr` (default 0.02): Learning rate for D's SGD, if SGD is used as the optimizer. (Note: There is no decay. You should use Adam or Adagrad.)
* `--D_SGD_momentum` (default 0): Momentum for D's SGD.
* `--G_adam_lr` (default -1): Adam learning rate for G (-1 is automatic).
* `--D_adam_lr` (default -1): Adam learning rate for D (-1 is automatic).
* `--G_L1` (default 0): L1 penalty on the weights of G.
* `--G_L2` (default 0): L2 penalty on the weights of G.
* `--D_L1` (default 0): L1 penalty on the weights of D.
* `--D_L2` (default 1e-4): L2 penalty on the weights of D.
* `--D_iterations` (default 1): How often to optimize D per batch (e.g. 2 for D and 1 for G means that D will be trained twice as much).
* `--G_iterations` (default 1): How often to optimize G per batch.
* `--D_maxAcc` (default 1.01): Stop training of D roughly around that accuracy level until G has catched up. (Sounds good in theory, doesn't produce good results in practice.)
* `--D_clamp` (default 1): To which value to clamp D's gradients (e.g. 5 means -5 to +5, 0 is off).
* `--G_clamp` (default 5): To which value to clamp G's gradients (e.g. 5 means -5 to +5, 0 is off).
* `--D_optmethod` (default "adam"): Optimizer to use for D, either "sgd" or "adam" or "adagrad".
* `--G_optmethod` (default "adam"): Optimizer to use for D, either "sgd" or "adam" or "adagrad".
* `--threads` (default 8): Number of threads.
* `--gpu` (default 0): Index of the GPU to train on (0-4 or -1 for cpu). Nothing is optimized for CPU.
* `--noiseDim` (default 100): Dimensionality of noise vector that will be fed into G.
* `--window` (default 3): ID of the first plotting window (in display), will also use about 3 window-ids beyond that.
* `--scale` (default 32): Scale of the images to train on (height, width). Loaded images will be converted to that size. Only optimized for 32.
* `--seed` (default 1): Seed to use for the RNG.
* `--weightsVisFreq` (default 0): How often to update the windows showing the activity of the network (only if >0; implies starting with `qlua` instead of `th` if set to >0).
* `--grayscale`: Whether to activate grayscale mode on the images, i.e. training will happen on grayscale images.
* `--denoise`: If added as parameter, the script will try to load a denoising autoencoder from `logs/denoiser_CxHxW.net`, where C is the number of image channels (1 or 3), H is the height of the images (see `--scale`) and W is the width. A denoiser can be trained using `train_denoiser.lua`.

# Other

* Training was done with Adam.
* Batch size was 32.
* The file `train_c2f.lua` is used to train a *coarse to fine* network of the laplacian pyramid. (Deprecated)
